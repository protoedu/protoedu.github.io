# Technology Development

## Scope of work
Protohaus spans the spectrum of technological development. We have done work on embedded systems for robots as well as full stack enterprise web development. From consumer to back-end warehouse enterprise applications.

> **Electrofie** *is a digital torch and applicator that uses smart sensing to thermostatically control the temperature of joint sealant.*
> 
> **Sony Screenblast** *was Sony’s first foray into a digital entertainment online destination that included movies, music, games, and social features.*

## Polyglot approach to building
Having a long-term view of technology helps to make a more informed decision on which stack to build on. 

> *We’ve worked with many programming languages and frameworks. Languages we are familiar with include but are not limited to Java, C, C++, Python, 
> Haskell, and Erlang. We are also well versed in all modern web-frameworks and DBs from Django to Rust and MongoDB to SQL. We have done hardware work on 
> ATmega, Arduino, Android, Snapdragon, ARM, Playstation, and Intel.*

## Modular iteration 
As we move from ideation to prototype both looks like and works like we will employ the right stack for the task at hand. Our approach is always to build modular components that can be stacked together in multiple configurations for different outcomes and experiments. 

> *We often start with paper prototypes or role-playing simulations to quickly frame ideas and look for design factors that lead to design opportunities. 
> We use a methodology called **Structured Planning** that allows us to build up bottom up function structures which maximizes functional support and 
> minimizes solution conflicts.*
